In this project, I am implementing an animal breeding system based on a custom database, utilizing a layered architecture. The application is structured into five layers, each responsible for specific tasks to improve readability and maintainability. I am using .NET 8.0 and Entity Framework Core, adhering to the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

The task consists of the following layers:

Domain Layer: Contains the Model classes used in solving the task.

Infrastructure Layer: Responsible for handling the database interactions.

Application Layer: Contains the business logic of the system.

Presentation Layer: Deals with the user interface and the display of the task.

Test Layer: Ensures the business logic is covered by unit tests.
